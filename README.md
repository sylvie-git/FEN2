# FEN3251 Assignment 2
## Goal
This is the code used to handle Assignment 2. The aim is to develop a Python application that enables to:
* create a grid using pandapower
* generate time series of voltage magnitudes and angles, knowing load and power generation values, corresponding to different operating states
* use K-means clusterung and K-nearest neighbors to label the voltage data ("guess" the operating state from voltage data).
## Technologies
This code has been developed and run with Python 3.7.
## Launch
The code is composed of 1 file: "main.py".
There are no dataset attached.
The data is generated by pandapower.

Adapting the path ("os.chdir") to the user's directory location is needed.
